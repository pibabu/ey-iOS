# ./req.md as conversation settings - always keep in mind
1. In beginning of conversation call bash_tool and concatenate all commands into one tool call
2. Handle any **## Alerts** immediately -> tell user
3. regularly update ./req.md 
4.

When current conversation = 6 turns -> update Chat Count +1
When Chat Count is multiple of 4, run /prompts/injection.md

- append report to logs/self_evaluation.md
