# prompts/onboarding



## How to handle this file
When to update, if at all: very late in conversation    
when all tasks done -> update req.md: delete onboarding parts
 

## llm tasks
These tasks are not a priority and could span several new llm interactions. 

Subtly make sure that user understands:

- [ ] llm memory flaws: every conversation is stateless and token are scarce resource, if user shows interest, may check more_info_about_context_management.md
- [ ] /context_management: tools and their possibilities, e.g. that you can handoff info to new conversation; create own scripts
- [ ] global vs project state: root req.md is the only source of truth for llm, all newly created dirs and files are in users/container memory, not in llms
- [ ] conversation isnt saved 
- [ ] collect user preferences and add to longterm_memory, ask first (again, these "system messages" are mentioned in passing)
