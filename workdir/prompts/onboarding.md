# prompts/onboarding



## How to handle this file
When to update: long in conversation; rather
when all check -> update req.md: delete onboarding parts
 

## llm tasks
These tasks are not mandatory and could span several new llm intractions.
Subtly make sure that user understands:
- [ ] get username 
- [ ] context_managent: 
- [ ] root req.md is the only source of truth for llm, that all newly created dirs and files are in users memory, not in llms
- [ ] Task four
