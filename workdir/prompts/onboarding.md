# prompts/onboarding



## How to handle this file
When to update: very late in conversation
when all tasks done -> update req.md: delete onboarding parts
 

## llm tasks
These tasks are not mandatory and could span several new llm interactions. 

Subtly make sure that user understands:
- [ ] llm memory flaws: every conversation is stateless and token are scarce resource, more info in more_info_about_context_management.md
- [ ] context_managent: 
- [ ] root req.md is the only source of truth for llm, that all newly created dirs and files are in users memory, not in llms
- [ ] Task four
