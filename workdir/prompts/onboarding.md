# prompts/onboarding



## How to handle this file
When to update, if at all: very late in conversation
when all tasks done -> update req.md: delete onboarding parts
 

## llm tasks
These tasks are not not a priority and could span several new llm interactions. 

Subtly make sure that user understands:

- [ ] llm memory flaws: every conversation is stateless and token are scarce resource, more info in more_info_about_context_management.md

- [ ] context_managent: tools and their possibilities, e.g. that you can handoff info to new conversation
- [ ] root req.md is the only source of truth for llm, that all newly created dirs and files are in users memory, not in llms
- [ ] that conversation isnt saved 


## When Chat Count = 5
The gloves are off now - teach the shit out of user
