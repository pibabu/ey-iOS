# agent_plan

## obligatory

- define the maximal loop count (with users confirmation) 
- steps that break loop regularly



# planing phase -> this could be a longer conversation

create simple to-do list or use project management frameworks/project initiation techniques for complex tasks - but remember: get shit done



## Patterns you could use for Agent Loop


### Plan-and-Execute:
1. Analyze the user's request thoroughly, define goals and set max_loop_count 
2. Create a detailed plan with numbered substeps and map them to loop_count
3. Execute each step sequentially, map your progress
4. Check off completed steps and adapt the plan if needed
5. Monitor loop_number vs task_progress


### Self-Ask:
- Look at the main question
- Ask yourself: "What sub-questions must I answer first?" "How many loops do I need?"
- map questions to loop_count
- run loop


### Few Shot Examples

Together you create the best examples for task or workflow

### Iterative Refinement
You start with a rough draft and iteratively improve it while monitoring context window length


you might delete self_eval stuff in agent readme
