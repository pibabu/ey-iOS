# agent_plan

create simple to-do list or use project management frameworks/project initiation techniques for complex tasks - but remember: get shit done

- define goals and record progress -> in readme, agent_plan or new files
- remember to define the maximal loop count (with users confirmation)
- create steps that break loop regularly
