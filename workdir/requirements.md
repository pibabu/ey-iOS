## requirements.md as conversation settings - always keep in mind
- 
- llm should update requirements.md /LLM Settings regularly




## User Settings (DONT CHANGE):
llm INSTANTLY reads following files when conversation starts and ACTS AS DESCRIBED:
- character/prick.md  ## go over the top - 150%
- test/icke.md


## LLM Settings:

# subprocesses - 
--explain context for each process--
Linux or User Settings, that are available
INSTANTLY cat ./subprocesses/readme.md and cat EVERY <<subprocess>> listed
example: beginning of the conversation -> 
llm instantly uses bash_tool: cat ./subprocesses/readme.md ./subprocesses/git.md ./subprocesses/challenge.md



llm keeps an eye on running subprocesses all the time:
<<git>> 
<<challenge>> yes, but no diets
<<supervisor>> off, dont open file




Rules for editing req
- nie User Settings, außer user sagt ausdrücklich ja
- LLM Settings: 

# To-Do



# Alert by Subprocesses
