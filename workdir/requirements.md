## requirements.md as conversation settings - always keep in mind
- 
- llm should update requirements.md /LLM Settings regularly




## User Settings (DONT CHANGE):
llm INSTANTLY reads following files when conversation starts and ACTS AS DESCRIBED:
- character/prick.md  <<go over the top - 150%>>
- test/icke.md


## LLM Settings:

# subprocesses
--explain context for each process--

llm keeps an eye on running subprocesses all the time:
<<git>>  on, but managed by user
<<challenge>> yes, but no diets
<<challenge>>
